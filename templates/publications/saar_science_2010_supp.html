		<p><strong><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS1.avi">Movie S1 Imaging of living species requires fast acquisition</a></strong>. CRS movie tuned into CH<sub>2</sub> stretching vibrations of lipids (2845 cm<sup>-1</sup>) showing a sebaceous gland in the epidermis of a live mouse. It can be seen how the sebaceous gland comes in and out of focus due to the breathing of the animal. If image acquisition is too slow this can cause blurring artifacts. The size of  the movie is 150 &micro;m with 512 x 512 sampling. Frame acquisitions time is 37 ms. </p>
		<p><strong><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS2.avi">Movie S2 Real time image acquisition</a></strong>. SRS movie tuned into CH<sub>2</sub> stretching vibrations of lipids (2845 cm<sup>-1</sup>) acquired in reflection mode from the back of the head of a nude mouse. Various imaging parameters are varied in real-time such as X-Y-position, depth, zoom-factor and viewing angle. This highlights the fact that real-time imaging can help with navigation  through the sample. The size of the initial frame is 400 &micro;m with 512 x 512  sampling. Frame acquisitions time is 37 ms.</p>
		<p><strong><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS3.avi">Movie S3 Blood-flow in real time.</a></strong> SRS movie tuned into CH<sub>3</sub> stretching vibration of proteins and lipids (2950 cm<sup>-1</sup>) acquired in transmission in a mouse ear. Movie shows a Y-shaped junction of blood capillaries with individual red blood cells. The size of the movie is 100 &micro;m with 512 x 512 sampling. Frame acquisitions time is 37 ms.</p>
		<p class="style9"><strong><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS4a.avi">Movie S4 Imaging of drug delivery <em>in vivo</em> (A)</a>, <a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS4b.avi">(B)</a>, <a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/saar_science_2010_supp/in_vivo_srs_movieS4c.avi">and (C)</a>.</strong> Three movies show the depth stacks of the same region of mouse ear skin treated with a drug-solution of <em>trans</em>-retinol at (A) CH<sub>3</sub> stretching vibration of proteins and lipid (2950 cm<sup>-1</sup>), (B) CH<sub>2</sub> stretching vibration of proteins and lipid (2845 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and (C) polyene stretching of the drug <em>trans</em>-retinol (1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>). The drug which has been topically applied is seen to penetrate deeper into skin down the shaft of a hair into the sebaceous gland. The size of the movie is 150 &micro;m with 512 x 512 sampling and the depth is 60 &micro;m. Frame acquisitions time is 37 ms.</p>
