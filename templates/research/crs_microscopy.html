		<p>Optical microscopy is unique among current imaging modalities in its ability to probe living specimens with subcellular resolution, enabling the visualization of morphological details in tissue and cells on the scale of a few hundred nanometers. The discovery and broad application of genetically encoded fluorophores, such as GFP and YFP, to tag specific proteins has had a considerable impact on modern microscopy. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy has superb sensitivity (see single molecule section). Labeling and staining may, however, perturb the studied system. This is especially true for small molecules, such as metabolites and drugs, for which the attachment of &lsquo;big&rsquo; labels can change the biological function.</p>
		<p>Raman microscopy is an alternative technique that enables label-free chemical imaging. It is based on the Raman scattering effect of molecules that was discovered by Indian scientist C.V. Raman in the early 1930s. When light is shined on a molecule, it can be inelastically scattered and gives off light at lower energy. All molecules have specific Raman signatures typically spanning from 100 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Figure 1 shows an example of the Raman spectrum of a biological cell. The Raman spectrum is highly dependent on the chemical structure, but almost unaffected by the local environment, of the molecule. Therefore, it is not only specific, but also quantitative.</p>

		<p>However, spontaneous Raman scattering (Fig. 2a) is typically very weak, and as a result, imaging based on spontaneous Raman is extremely slow. Coherent Raman imaging, including stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), shown in Fig. 2b and 2c, respectively, allows the enhancement of the weak Raman signal by means of nonlinear excitation, enabling imaging to speed up to video-rate.</p>

Both pump- and Stokes-frequencies are incident on the sample. If the frequency difference &Delta;&omega; = &omega;<sub>p</sub> - &omega;<sub>S</sub> matches a molecular vibration of the sample &Omega;, stimulated excitation of vibration transitions occurs. The intensity of the pump-field experiences a loss (SRL) and the Stokes-field a gain (SRG). c) Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy is a four-wave mixing process generating a new field at the anti-Stokes frequency &omega;<sub>as</sub> = 2&omega;<sub>p</sub>- &omega;<sub>s</sub>.

			<p>Vibrational spectra of biological specimens contain a multitude of molecular signatures that can be used for identifying biochemical constituents in tissue. Infrared absorption (FT-IR) microscopy is limited by low spatial resolution due to the long wavelength of infrared light and low penetration depth into biological specimens due to strong water absorption. Spontaneous Raman scattering (Fig. 2a), overcoming the problems associated with the long excitation wavelengths, lacks the sensitivity required for rapid imaging. Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) and Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS), shown in Fig. 2b and 2c, respectively, allow the enhancement of the weak Raman signal by means of nonlinear excitation, enabling imaging to speed up to video-rate.</p>

			<li>Stimulated excitation of vibrational transitions in SRS and coherent signal accumulation in CARS produces a strong directional signal, making Coherent Raman Imaging much more sensitive than conventional vibrational microscopy.

		<p><h3 id="cars">Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)</h3></p>
		<p>CARS is a four-wave mixing process in which a pump beam at frequency &omega;<sub>p</sub> and a Stokes beam at frequency &omega;<sub>s</sub> interact with a sample to generate an anti-Stokes signal at frequency &omega;<sub>as</sub> = 2&omega;<sub>p</sub> - &omega;<sub>S</sub> . When the beat frequency between the pump and Stokes &Delta;&omega; matches the frequency of a particular Raman active molecular vibration &Omega;, the resonant oscillators are coherently driven. This generates a nonlinear polarization of the sample that radiates the anti-Stokes signal. Because the radiation is emitted coherently, the CARS signal is strongly enhanced compared to the spontaneous Raman scattering signal, for which Stokes and anti-Stokes photons are emitted incoherently.</p>
		<p>In contrast to SRS, CARS is a parametric process, i.e., no energy is transferred into the sample but the difference energy between the pump- and Stokes-photon is carried away by the anti-Stokes field. As a result, CARS can also occur when there are no resonant molecules in the focal volumes. This gives rise to a nonresonant background that can limit the sensitivity and alter the CARS spectra from spontaneous Raman spectra. We developed several detection schemes for CARS microscopy to overcome this background.</p>
		<p><h5 class="subheader">Detection Schemes for CARS:</h5></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/andreas_prl_1999.pdf">Forward CARS (F-CARS)</a></li>
			<p>The signal is detected in the phase-matched direction and the signal is selected by a set of spectral filters. The F-CARS signals are generally very strong and can sometimes be observed by the naked eye.</p>
			<li><a href="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/andreas_prl_2001.pdf">Epi CARS (E-CARS)</a></li>
			<p>The forward CARS signal is accompanied by a strong nonresonant background which may overshadow weak signals that are of interest. When detected in the backward direction, the nonresonant signal from the solvent (water) is completely eliminated. E-CARS is particularly sensitive to objects in focus that are smaller than the optical wavelength. When the sample is highly scattering, the forward propagating CARS signal can be backscattered, giving rise to a strong epi-signal.</p>

		<p><h3 id="srs">Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)</h3></p>
		<p>In spontaneous Raman scattering, only one laser beam at a frequency &omega;<sub>p</sub> illuminates the sample and the signal is generated at the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies, &omega;<sub>s</sub> and &omega;<sub>as</sub>, respectively, due to inelastic scattering. In SRS, however, two laser beams at &omega;<sub>p</sub> and &omega;<sub>S</sub> coincide on the sample.&nbsp;When the difference frequency &Delta;&omega;=&omega;<sub>p</sub>-&omega;<sub>S</sub> (also called the Raman shift), matches a particular molecular vibrational frequency &Omega;, amplification of the Raman signal is achieved by virtue of stimulated excitation of molecular transition rate r. r ~ &sigma;<sub>Raman</sub>&middot;n<sub>p</sub>&middot;(n<sub>S</sub>+1)&nbsp;. &sigma;<sub>Raman</sub> is the (Raman-shift dependent) Raman scattering cross-section of the molecule and np and n<sub>S</sub> are the number of photons per mode in the pump and Stokes fields, respectively. In the absence of the Stokes-beam (n<sub>S</sub>=0), the unity in the equation above accounts for spontaneous Raman scattering. Under our typical excitation condition n<sub>S</sub> is, however,&nbsp;bigger than 10<sup>7</sup>; hence, stimulated Raman scattering provides amplification at the vibrational transition rate. As a consequence of the amplified energy transition rate, the intensity of the Stokes beam, I<sub>S</sub>, experiences a gain, &Delta;I<sub>S</sub>, (stimulated Raman gain, SRG) and the intensity of the pump beam, Ip, experiences a loss, &Delta;I<sub>p</sub>, (stimulated Raman loss, SRL). Either &Delta;I<sub>S</sub> or &Delta;I<sub>p</sub> can be used as vibrational contrast for SRG and SRL microscopy, respectively. </p>
		<p>SRS cannot occur when &Delta;&omega; does not match any vibrational resonance that absorbs the difference energy from the fields. Thus, SRS does not have a nonresonant background signal. The intensity of SRG or SRL is described by &Delta;I<sub>S</sub> ~ N &middot; &sigma;Raman&middot; Ip&middot; IS&nbsp;and &Delta;I<sub>p</sub> ~ - N &middot; &sigma;Raman&middot; Ip&middot; IS , where N is the number of molecules in the probe volume. As in two-photon microscopy, the nonlinearity of SRS in the overall excitation intensity is the basis for 3D sectioning, which allows for point-by-point three-dimensional imaging of thick specimens. </p>
		<p>In contrast to the CARS signal that is generated at the anti-Stokes frequency, SRG and SRL occur at the frequency of the excitation beams. Although the Raman signal is greatly enhanced, SRL and SRG are relativity small compared to the intensity of the excitation beams (&Delta;I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>p</sub> and &Delta;I<sub>S</sub>/I<sub>S</sub> &lt;10<sup>-4</sup>) under biocompatible illumination conditions and are thus buried in the laser noise. Realizing that laser noise occurs primarily at low frequencies, a high-frequency phase-sensitive detection scheme is critical. As shown in Fig.1, one can modulate the intensity of the Stokes beam (&gt;1MHz) and detect the resulting intensity modulation of the pump beam due to SRL at the same frequency with a lock-in amplifier. The lock-in amplifier signal can be directly fed into the D/A-converter of the microscope. Similarly, SRG can be measured by modulating the pump beam and detecting the Stokes beam. The high intensity laser light can best be detected with a large-area photodiode with high reverse bias voltage to allow the time-response needed from MHz-modulation. With this approach, &Delta;I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>p</sub> as small as 10<sup>-8</sup> can be achieved with a 1s time constant. This is close to the shot-noise-limit. </p>
		<div class="text-center"><img src="{{MEDIA_URL}}research/SRSmodualtionScheme.jpg"></div>
		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>Fig.1: Modulation scheme for SRL microscopy.</strong> In order to detect the relatively small signal from the background of excitation laser beams, the SRS signal must be modulated faster than the laser noise (MHz). To detect SRL, the Stokes-beam can be modulated with an acusto-optic modulator.&nbsp; The SRL signal can be extracted from the detected intensity of the pump intensity with a lock-in amplifier. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We detected SRL instead of SRG because the responsivity of the photodiode used is higher for the pump than for the Stokes beam. Collinear pump- and Stokes-beams are focused with a high numerical aperture objective onto a common focal spot (Fig.2). To detect the pump- or Stokes-beams in the forward direction, we recommend using a condenser with a numerical aperture higher than that of the excitation objective, in order to minimize unwanted background due to cross-phase-modulation, which may yield a spurious background.</p>
		<p>Epi (backward) detection is possible in turbid samples because multiple scattering events redirect a significant portion of the forward propagating pump and Stokes beams to the backward direction, which can be collected with the same excitation objective lens. The excitation light is separated from the detection light with a polarizing beam splitter and quarter-waveplate in a double-pass geometry.</p>

		<p><h3 id="applications">Applications of Coherent Raman Imaging</h3></p>
		<p>Coherent Raman microscopy (CRM) is a chemically-selective imaging modality that provides microscopic contrast without the need of labels. It is a rapidly developing technique that is constantly finding new and exciting applications. Here we show some examples of our work in the past a few years.</p>
		<p><h5 class="subheader">Studying Lipid Metabolism</h5></p>
		<p>Many experiments in cell biology are limited by the use of perturbative labels. Fluorophores, beads, or metal particles can have large effects on the behavior of a labeled molecule or organelle in a living organism. Lipid droplets have recently emerged as important intracellular organelles relevant for widespread human diseases such as diabetes, hepatosteatosis and atherosclerosis. The ability to visualize lipid droplets within cells and study their biogenesis and function, however, is hampered by the lack of specific staining dyes, as well as the aforementioned problems associated with labeling. CRM&rsquo;s exquisite sensitivity to lipids makes it an ideal tool to study lipid cell biology.</p>
		<p>We used RNA interference screening to study the regulatory genes affecting the lipid storage in <em>C. elegans </em>[1]. Figure 1 shows the SRS image of wild-type and mutant <em>C. elegans</em> at 2845 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The contrast is mostly from lipids, revealing the lipid content in the intestine.</p>

		<p><h5 class="subheader">Imaging Drug Delivery</h5></p>
		<p>CRM is an ideal tool for tissue imaging. As a nonlinear effect, CRM can be used to image tissue with subcellular 3D spatial resolution to carry out optical biopsy with chemical selectivity. CRM microscopy has been successfully used to study skin tissue in vivo in real-time at video-rate speeds. </p>
		<p>We used CRM to study the dynamics of drug penetration through the stratum corneum layer of skin. Figure 2 shows the time lapse SRS images of the drug ketoprofen at 1595 cm<sup>-1</sup> with a penetration depth of 12 mm [2]. Their monotonic decrease from the skin surface into the barrier and temporal evolution are both qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with data from the far more invasive and labor-intensive tape-stripping results. It also suggests a diffusion lag-time on the order of 2 h. </p>

		<p><h5 class="subheader">Tumor Diagnosis</h5></p>
		<p>CRM microscopy provides an interesting new contrast mechanism for imaging tumors in tissue. In particular, by making use of differences in lipid density and protein density, the nuclei morphology can be derived, providing contrast analogous to H&amp;E histopathology. Tumor margins can be seen with subcellular spatial resolution in fresh, unstained tissue. </p>
		<p>Figure 3 shows the post-processed SRS images of both primary and metastatic tumors, highlighting the lipids (green) and nucleic contrast (blue). As can be seen, not only the tumor margin can be identified, but the margin of the primary tumor and metastatic tumor are also distinguishable. Comparison with histological data and Raman spectroscopy has established the chemical selectivity of the technique, and efforts to establish the use of CRM as a tool for virtual histology during brain tumor surgery are underway.</p>

		<p><h5 class="subheader">Applications outside Biomedicine</h5></p>
		<p>As a chemically sensitive technique, CARS microscopy has many applications outside biomedicine. One example is studying degradation of cellulose and lignin for biofuel production. Research of biofuels has experienced dramatic growth in recent years. The major challenge to be overcome in the widespread adoption of many biofuels is that biomass is intrinsically recalcitrant, partly caused by one of the two main chemical species in biomass, lignin. The SRS microscopy method can offer new information on the biomass conversion processes. Figure 5 shows the real-time monitoring of the hydrolysis kinetics of cellulose and lignins under chlorite treatment.</p>
